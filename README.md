## 🌐 About This Repository

> **Important Note**  
> This repository only contains the **frontend and application-facing code** (Flask app, routing, HTML/CSS templates).  
> The cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Functions, API calls, and backend logic) is **not included here**.

This means you're seeing the interface and local structure that connects to the cloud, not the full cloud processing logic itself.
